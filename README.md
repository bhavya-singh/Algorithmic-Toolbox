# Algorithmic-Toolbox
>Course 1/6 in the Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization  
by University of California San Diego &amp; National Research University Higher School of Economics

- An intermediate level graded course on Coursera.
- 6 weeks of committment

#### Course Description:

The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications:
- sorting and searching
- divide and conquer
- greedy algorithms
- dynamic programming

&

A lot of theory: 
- how to sort data and how it helps for searching
- how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively
- when it makes sense to proceed greedily
- how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies
